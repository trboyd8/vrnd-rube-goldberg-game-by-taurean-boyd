# Rube Goldberg Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Platforms
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
- Windows 10
- SteamVR plugin 1.2.3
- Oculus

## How long it took to create?
~10 Hours

## What I liked about the project?
This was the first exposure to high immersion and it was nice to be able to "live" inside the game I'm creating.

## What I found challenging about the project?
There is a lot of freedom in this project and that can make things difficult. Once you create the rube goldberg objects, it's really difficult to come up with levels that work well with those objects.
